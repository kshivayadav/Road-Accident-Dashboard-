# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **INTERACTIVE EXCEL DASHBOARD** built to analyze and visualize **ROAD ACCIDENT DATA** across multiple dimensions such as severity, vehicle types, road conditions, and trends.  
The dashboard provides **ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS** that can help road safety authorities, policymakers, and transport planners reduce accidents and casualties.



## 🎯 Key Features
- **Primary KPIs**: Total, Fatal, Serious, Slight casualties  
- **Secondary KPIs**: Casualties by vehicle type  
- **Monthly Trends**: Current Year vs Previous Year comparison  
- **Road Type, Surface & Weather Analysis**  
- **Area-wise (Urban vs Rural) & Light Condition Analysis**  
- **Interactive Filters (Slicers)** for Year, Weather, and Wind Conditions  
- **Navigation Buttons**:  
  -  *Database icon* → Navigate to Pivot Tables sheet  
  - 📊 *Dashboard icon* → Return to Dashboard sheet  
  - ✅ Makes the Excel file behave like a **mini BI application**  



## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts  
- Donut, Line, Bar & Tree Map Visualizations  
- Slicers for interactive filtering  
- Shapes & Icons for storytelling & navigation  
- Conditional Formatting for severity insights  



## 📊 Dashboard Insights

### 🔴 Severity of Casualties
- **648,788 total casualties**  
  - Fatal: 11,132 (1.7%)  
  - Serious: 93,343 (14.4%)  
  - Slight: 544,313 (83.9%)  
✅ Majority of cases are slight injuries, but the fatal share (1.7%) still represents a significant loss of life.


### 🚗 Vehicle-Wise Casualties
- Cars: **511,357 (78.8%)**  
- Goods Vans: 54,003  
- Bikes: 53,302  
- Buses: 22,745  
✅ Cars & two-wheelers are the **most accident-prone vehicles**, requiring stronger road safety measures.  



### 🛣️ Road Type Analysis
- Single Carriageways: **479,641 (74%)**  
- Dual Carriageways: 105,328  
- Roundabouts: 41,287  
✅ **Single Carriageways** are the **riskiest road type**, highlighting the need for infrastructure upgrades.  



### 🌍 Area-Wise Distribution
- Urban: 395,580 casualties  
- Rural: 253,195 casualties  
✅ Urban roads face **more accidents** due to traffic density and congestion.  



### 🌞 Light Condition
- Daylight: 471,287 (73%)  
- Darkness: 177,501 (27%)  
✅ Although daytime sees more accidents, night time accidents are usually **more severe** due to poor visibility.
  


### 🌦️ Road Surface & Weather
- Dry: 431,426 (67%)  
- Wet: 187,853 (29%)  
- Snow/Ice: 28,856 (4%)  
✅ Most accidents happen in **normal (dry) conditions**, indicating **driver behavior** is a bigger factor than weather.  



### 📅 Monthly Trends
- Accidents **rise mid-year** and **peak in Oct–Nov**  
- Drop in December → possible seasonal or enforcement impact  
✅ Repeated trend indicates **predictable high-risk months**.  



## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Automating refresh with **Power Query**  
- Connecting with **live datasets (CSV/SQL)**  
- Adding predictive trends (accident hotspots)  
- More KPIs like **accidents per 1,000 vehicles**
